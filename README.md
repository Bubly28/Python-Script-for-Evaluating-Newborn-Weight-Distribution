# Python-Script-for-Evaluating-Newborn-Weight-Distribution
Contained within this repository is a Python script engineered to assess the distribution of newborn weights across designated regions of Europe. The script parses a dataset from a CSV file, constructs a histogram for visualizing weight distribution, computes the mean weight (ùëäÃÉ), and determines the proportion of newborns falling within a specified weight interval (X). This analysis underscores adeptness in applying computational algorithms, statistical methodologies, and mathematical competencies to tackle data-centric challenges. The script is compatible with Spyder, requiring no supplementary libraries, thus ensuring accessibility and simplicity for further analysis or educational endeavors.
